## What?

A tracking system, also known as a locating system, is used for the observing of persons or objects on the move and 
supplying a timely ordered sequence of location data for further processing.

## Why?

How many domains to explore for code injection, path traversal, faulty access controls, misconfigurations??? 
Overwhelmed by the number of possibilities? How much time to spend on what? What are we overlooking?

## How?

* [Revealing hidden domains](domains.md)
* [Investigating S3 URLs](s3-urls.md)
* [Server-side request forgery](ssrf.md)
