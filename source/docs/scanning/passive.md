# Passive scanning

With passive scanning there is no interaction with the target hosts, but traffic
on the target network is captured to see what can be picked up.

* Monitor network traffic for source and destination IP addresses to understand the hosts that exist on the network.
* Inspect packets to discover usernames and passwords, or other confidential information, and layer-2 addresses
(MAC addresses).

ðŸ‘‰ MAC addresses of valid clients can possibly be spoofed to bypass security controls.
