# Job listing sites

Job advertisements can also tell you a lot about a company. In addition to revealing names and email addresses, 
job posts for technical positions could give insight into the target companyâ€™s systems and infrastructure. The 
popular job posts might vary from one country to another. Make sure to check job listing sites in the countries 
where your client would post their ads. And it is always worth checking their website for any job opening 
and seeing if this can leak any interesting information.
