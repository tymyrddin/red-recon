# Social media

Social media websites have become very popular for not only personal use but also for corporate use. Some social 
media platforms can reveal tons of information about the target. This is especially true as many users tend to 
overshare details about themselves and their work. To name but a few, it's worthwhile checking the following:

* LinkedIn
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Instagram

Social media scraping can help discover names, email addresses, phone numbers, biographies.
