# Introduction

## What?

Collecting public information from the Internet about the target organisation, without invoking any kind of 
communication with the target systems. The term used for discovering information from public data sources available 
on the Internet is called open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering.

## Why?

The more useful information about a target, the more vulnerabilities in the target and more serious problems 
found for exploiting them (to demonstrate).
