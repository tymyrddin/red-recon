## What?

Gathering information about a target system that can be used to execute a successful attack. To get this information, use various methods with variant tools.

## Why?

* Analyse the security posture of the target and find loopholes for creating an attack plan.
* Using different tools and techniques, narrow down the range of IP addresses.
* Use the collected information to identify weaknesses in the target's security.
* Graphically represent the targetâ€™s network, so it can be used as a guide during the attack.

## How?

* [Gather network information](network.md)
* [Gather system information](system.md)
* [Collect organisation information](organisation.md)
