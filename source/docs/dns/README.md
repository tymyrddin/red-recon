# Introduction

## What?

Discover domain name and IP address information and identify the technical contact and administrator contact 
information for that company or domain and use additional tools to query DNS for different types of DNS records.

ðŸ‘‰ If zone transfers are not refused, make sure to document that in the report.

## Why?

The more useful information about a target, the more vulnerabilities in the target and more serious problems 
found for exploiting them (to demonstrate).
