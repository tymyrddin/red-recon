# Introduction

## What?

Identify the domains using a combination of Whois lookups and DNS profiling. Use tools such as Whois,
Shodan, and recon-ng to collect domain information. Identify the technical contact and administrator contact 
information for that company or domain and use additional tools to query DNS for different types of DNS records.

ðŸ‘‰ If zone transfers are not refused, make sure to document that in the report.

## Why?

The more useful information about a target, the more vulnerabilities in the target and more serious problems 
found for exploiting them (to demonstrate).
