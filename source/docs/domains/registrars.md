# Registrars

## DNS registrars

For an organisation or company to host its own e-mail, web, ftp, or any other service on the Internet, it must have 
each of these servers listed within the DNS infrastructure. These DNS servers list the names of the servers, along 
with the IP addresses that can be used to access these services. Internet Protocol (IP) address information is 
publicly available via the ARIN and many other Internet registering authorities. Anyone can begin a search using 
a single known IP address. The search will yield the complete block of IP addresses belonging to the organisation or 
company. 

Whois databases contain this information and much of it can be accessed via the internet (web and cli).

* Look up the target at [InterNIC](https://www.internic.net/whois.html) to find out who the registrar is
* Go to the (RIR) whois database to get detailed records.
