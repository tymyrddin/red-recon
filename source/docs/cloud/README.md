# Introduction

## What?

Cloud recon. Focus on S3 first. The growing number of Amazon Web Services S3 “data leaks” are due to human 
intervention – specifically, users who have not correctly configured S3 bucket policies, and as a result, 
allow public access to S3.

In general, a lack of understanding when implementing S3, or carelessness when evaluating what should or should 
not be available for public consumption.

## Why?

To gain information for initial [access in the cloud](red-cloud:index).
